#Instructions

This is a simple translation of my node.js script for infinistream prettification.

It is in fact so simple that I didn't write tests for it (which I realize is taboo, but to be honest I have no opinions/strategies for effective unit testing in python, and figured I'd spare you the experience of reading my first few experiments with it)

I wrote this to demonstrate basic competency in python, and would like it noted that I'm aware my python coding skills could use work

If installed and configured then pyenv will manage the python version for you, else just make sure your environment exposes python 3.4.1 (I haven't tested on other versions)

when ready, execute ```python reader.py```, *make sure the ugly data server is running*
