#Instructions

this is fairly straightforward:
* install by running npm install (make sure that you're running it from this folder)
* run tests with global mocha (just enter "mocha")
* or run 
```bash
gulp test
```
* execute the reader by entering
```bash
node reader.js
```

*note that there are no tests for the reader its self because I figured it was a straightforward enough wrapper*
